# Library_Manegement_SQL

I have hands-on experience in database development and management, with a specialization in library management systems. In one of my recent projects, I designed and implemented a comprehensive database using SQL for a library.

The database structure consists of three primary tables: Patrons, Books, and Loans. The Patrons table stores essential information about library patrons, including their first name, last name, email address, and a unique patron ID. The Books table holds data related to the library's collection, such as the book ID, title, author, publication year, and a unique barcode. The Loans table records loan transactions, including the loan ID, book ID, patron ID, loan date, due date, and returned date.

To ensure data integrity and reliability, I incorporated primary key constraints on the PatronID, BookID, and LoanID columns. Additionally, I set a unique constraint on the Barcode column in the Books table to prevent duplicate entries.

During the development process, I utilized SQL INSERT statements to populate the Patrons and Books tables with sample data. This data includes a diverse range of patron profiles, including their names, email addresses, and assigned patron IDs. Similarly, the Books table contains various book entries with details such as titles, authors, publication years, book IDs, and barcodes.

By leveraging this robust database system, library staff can efficiently manage patron information, track book availability, and streamline loan processes. The database enables seamless operations, including retrieving information on the number of available copies of a specific book and generating comprehensive reports on loan history.

My involvement in this library management project demonstrates my expertise in database design, SQL programming, and the ability to create efficient and scalable solutions tailored to the unique needs of library environments.
